📦 Getting Started

Backend (Flask)
cd backend
pip install flask flask-cors
python app.py

Frontend (React)
cd frontend
npm install
npm start

Make sure Flask server is running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 and React app on http://localhost:3000.


⚠️ Note

The backend generates a random 4-digit number with no repeated digits.
CORS must be properly configured for local development.


✨ Future Improvements

Add leaderboard (guesses + time)
Difficulty levels (3-digit, 4-digit, etc.)
Keyboard-based input (like Wordle)
Animations and transitions
